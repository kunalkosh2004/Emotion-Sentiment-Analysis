#Emotion and Sentiment Analysis

#Overview

This repository implements an Emotion and Sentiment Analysis project. The primary goal is to analyze text data to identify underlying emotions and sentiments, using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

#Features

Emotion Detection: Identifies emotions like joy, anger, sadness, fear, etc.

Sentiment Analysis: Categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and other preprocessing steps.

Machine Learning Models: Implements various ML models to classify sentiments and emotions.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the models.

#Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

pip or another Python package manager

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kunalkosh2004/Emotion-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Emotion-Sentiment-Analysis

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory.

Update paths in the scripts if needed.

Usage

Preprocessing Data

Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:

python src/preprocess.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/processed_data.csv

Training the Model

Train the model using the preprocessed dataset:

python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.json

Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model and generate performance metrics:

python src/evaluate.py --model models/saved_model.pkl --data data/test_data.csv

Dataset

Input Format: Text data with labeled emotions and sentiments.

Output Format: Predicted labels for emotions and sentiments.

Results

Accuracy: 50+%(Working on it right now)


Results and visualizations can be found in the results/ directory.
